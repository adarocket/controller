Black Rocket Controller is a central point of Black Rocket solution, it gathers the information from the end-point clients (informers) about node state, stores it and provides this information to the other components (alerter and monitoring app).

## How to install Controller

### Installing directly from the binaries

Upcoming, not available yet due to active development.

Binaries will be abailable for Linux only.

### Installing Go
Controller requires Go 1.16 to compile, please refer to the [official documentation](https://go.dev/doc/install) for how to install Go in your system.

### Installing Controller:
```

### Ð¡onfiguration 
The next step is to create a configuration file. It is necessary to list in the "nodes" list all informers that need to be connected to the controller.
* ticker - name of the informer.
* uuid - unique id of the informer.

```
cat << EOF > ~/etc/ada-rocket/controller.conf
{
    "server_port":"5300",
    "nodes":[
        {
            "ticker":"informer 1 name",
            "uuid":"informer 1 uuid"
        },
          ...
        {
            "ticker":"informer N name",
            "uuid":"informer N uuid"
        }
    ]
}
EOF
```

### Setup ufw
If you have a firewall installed, you need to open port 5300. To do this, you need to run the following command:
